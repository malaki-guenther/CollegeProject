Investment Project File
  -program takes 4 inputs being a initial investment monthly deposit, anual intrest, and finally the number of years.
  it then outputs a table showing what the end of year balance, and year end earned interest would be for each year.
  
I managed to figure out how to set up the head file and the cpp file when they are not added to the program directly. 
I accidentally pressed create new item and then later had to add it to the solution. other than that the coding was all pretty basic.

pretty happ with most of it. There are probably some areas where I could have used string methods to make the program easier to read,
specifically when dealing with the underlines.

I still find header files to be pretty hard to create as I have had several issues when writing them. I do eventaully figure it out, but
its not easy.

how to create header files

I gave it a class that can be given new methods and made the driver function seperate incase we want to change the input and output text told.
